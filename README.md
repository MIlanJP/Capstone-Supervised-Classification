# Company Bankruptcy Prediction
## (Supervised Machine Learning Classification)
### Abstract: Yet we have a classification problem that is related to the Business, Economics, banking sector, We are given data that is collected from the Taiwan economic journal for the year 1999 to 2009 that is company bankruptcy prediction, the company bankruptcy was defined based on the business regulations of the Taiwan Stock Exchange, Getting to know whether a corporate company about its bankruptcy it is a very important economic importance as it affects the stakeholders and the prediction of corporate bankruptcy has been used in most of the studies in Economics accounting and other decision Sciences from past 20 years, therefore, the primary purpose of this prediction is to come up with a model that can give a good prediction about the bankruptcy of the companies

### Problem Statement:
### The prediction of bankruptcy is a phenomenon of increasing interest to firms who stand to lose money because of unpaid debts. Since computers can store huge datasets about bankruptcy making accurate predictions from them beforehand is becoming important.
The data were collected from the Taiwan Economic Journal for the years 1999 to 2009. Company bankruptcy was defined based on the business regulations of the Taiwan Stock Exchange.
In this project, you will use various classification algorithms on the bankruptcy datasets to predict bankruptcies with satisfying accuracies long before the actual event.
